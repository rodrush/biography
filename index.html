            “I am fundamentally an optimist. Part of being optimistic is keeping
            one’s head pointed toward the sun, one’s feet moving forward. There
            were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested,
            but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way
            lays defeat and death.”</em

      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>
        Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of
        Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi
        Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela, principal
        counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba
        Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his father died and the
        young Rolihlahla became a ward of Jongintaba at the Great Place in
        Mqhekezweni.

        He attended primary school in Qunu where his teacher, Miss Mdingane,
        gave him the name Nelson, in accordance with the custom of giving all
        schoolchildren “Christian” names. He completed his Junior Certificate at
        Clarkebury Boarding Institute and went on to Healdtown, a Wesleyan
        secondary school of some repute, where he matriculated. Mandela began
        his studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University College of
        Fort Hare but did not complete the degree there as he was expelled for
        joining in a student protest. On his return to the Great Place at
        Mqhekezweni the King was furious and said if he didn’t return to Fort
        Hare he would arrange wives for him and his cousin Justice. They ran
        away to Johannesburg instead, arriving there in 1941. There he worked as
        a mine security officer and after meeting Walter Sisulu, an estate
        agent, he was introduced to Lazer Sidelsky. He then did his articles
        through a firm of attorneys – Witkin, Eidelman and Sidelsky.

      <p>
        He completed his BA through the University of South Africa and went back
        to Fort Hare for his graduation in 1943. Meanwhile, he began studying
        for an LLB at the University of the Witwatersrand. By his own admission
        he was a poor student and left the university in 1952 without
        graduating. He only started studying again through the University of
        London after his imprisonment in 1962 but also did not complete that
        degree. In 1989, while in the last months of his imprisonment, he
        obtained an LLB through the University of South Africa. He graduated in
        absentia at a ceremony in Cape Town.

      <h2>Politics</h2>
      <p>
        Mandela, while increasingly politically involved from 1942, only joined
        the African National Congress in 1944 when he helped to form the ANC
        Youth League (ANCYL). In 1944 he married Walter Sisulu’s cousin, Evelyn
        Mase, a nurse. They had two sons, Madiba Thembekile "Thembi" and
        Makgatho, and two daughters both called Makaziwe, the first of whom died
        in infancy. He and his wife divorced in 1958. Mandela rose through the
        ranks of the ANCYL and through its efforts, the ANC adopted a more
        radical mass-based policy, the Programme of Action, in 1949.
        <img src="./images/politics.jpg" alt="" class="mand" />In 1952 he was
        chosen as the National Volunteer-in-Chief of the Defiance Campaign with
        Maulvi Cachalia as his deputy. This campaign of civil disobedience
        against six unjust laws was a joint programme between the ANC and the
        South African Indian Congress. He and 19 others were charged under the
        Suppression of Communism Act for their part in the campaign and
        sentenced to nine months of hard labour, suspended for two years. A
        two-year diploma in law on top of his BA allowed Mandela to practise
        law, and in August 1952 he and Oliver Tambo established South Africa’s
        first black law firm, Mandela & Tambo. At the end of 1952 he was banned
        for the first time. As a restricted person he was only permitted to
        watch in secret as the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown on 26
        June 1955.
      </p>

      <h2>Trial</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/trial.jpg" alt="" class="mand" />
        Mandela was arrested in a countrywide police swoop on 5 December 1956,
        which led to the 1956 Treason Trial. Men and women of all races found
        themselves in the dock in the marathon trial that only ended when the
        last 28 accused, including Mandela, were acquitted on 29 March 1961. On
        21 March 1960 police killed 69 unarmed people in a protest in
        Sharpeville against the pass laws. This led to the country’s first state
        of emergency and the banning of the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress
        (PAC) on 8 April. Mandela and his colleagues in the Treason Trial were
        among thousands detained during the state of emergency. During the trial
        Mandela married a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, on 14 June 1958.
        They had two daughters, Zenani and Zindziswa. The couple divorced in
        1996. Days before the end of the Treason Trial, Mandela travelled to
        Pietermaritzburg to speak at the All-in Africa Conference, which
        resolved that he should write to Prime Minister Verwoerd requesting a
        national convention on a non-racial constitution, and to warn that
        should he not agree there would be a national strike against South
        Africa becoming a republic. After he and his colleagues were acquitted
        in the Treason Trial, Mandela went underground and began planning a
        national strike for 29, 30 and 31 March. In the face of massive
        mobilisation of state security the strike was called off early. In June
        1961 he was asked to lead the armed struggle and helped to establish
        <em>Umkhonto weSizwe</em> (Spear of the Nation), which launched on 16
        December 1961 with a series of explosions.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 11 January 1962, using the adopted name David Motsamayi, Mandela
        secretly left South Africa. He travelled around Africa and visited
        England to gain support for the armed struggle. He received military
        training in Morocco and Ethiopia and returned to South Africa in July
        1962. He was arrested in a police roadblock outside Howick on 5 August
        while returning from KwaZulu-Natal, where he had briefed ANC President
        Chief Albert Luthuli about his trip. He was charged with leaving the
        country without a permit and inciting workers to strike. He was
        convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment, which he began
        serving at the Pretoria Local Prison. On 27 May 1963 he was transferred
        to Robben Island and returned to Pretoria on 12 June. Within a month
        police raided Liliesleaf, a secret hideout in Rivonia, Johannesburg,
        used by ANC and Communist Party activists, and several of his comrades
        were arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/rivonia.jpg" alt="" class="mand" />
        On 9 October 1963 Mandela joined 10 others on trial for sabotage in what
        became known as the Rivonia Trial. While facing the death penalty his
        words to the court at the end of his famous
        <strong>"Speech from the Dock"</strong> on 20 April 1964 became
        immortalised:
      </p>
      <p class="speech">
        <em
          >"I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against
          black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free
          society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal
          opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.
          But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        On 11 June 1964 Mandela and seven other accused, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed
        Kathrada, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba, Denis Goldberg, Elias Motsoaledi
        and Andrew Mlangeni, were convicted and the next day were sentenced to
        life imprisonment. Goldberg was sent to Pretoria Prison because he was
        white, while the others went to Robben Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mandela’s mother died in 1968 and his eldest son, Thembi, in 1969. He
        was not allowed to attend their funerals. On 31 March 1982 Mandela was
        transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town with Sisulu, Mhlaba and
        Mlangeni. Kathrada joined them in October. When he returned to the
        prison in November 1985 after prostate surgery, Mandela was held alone.
        Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee visited him in hospital. Later Mandela
        initiated talks about an ultimate meeting between the apartheid
        government and the ANC.
      </p>

      <h2>Release from Prison</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/released.jpg" alt="" class="mand" />
        On 12 August 1988 he was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with
        tuberculosis. After more than three months in two hospitals he was
        transferred on 7 December 1988 to a house at Victor Verster Prison near
        Paarl where he spent his last 14 months of imprisonment. He was released
        from its gates on Sunday 11 February 1990, nine days after the unbanning
        of the ANC and the PAC and nearly four months after the release of his
        remaining Rivonia comrades. Throughout his imprisonment he had rejected
        at least three conditional offers of release. Mandela immersed himself
        in official talks to end white minority rule and in 1991 was elected ANC
        President to replace his ailing friend, Oliver Tambo. In 1993 he and
        President FW de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize and on 27 April
        1994 he voted for the first time in his life.
      </p>

      <h2>President</h2>
      <img src="./images/mand.png" alt="" class="mand2" />
      <p>
        On 10 May 1994 he was inaugurated as South Africa’s first democratically
        elected President. On his 80th birthday in 1998 he married Graça Machel,
        his third wife. True to his promise, Mandela stepped down in 1999 after
        one term as President. He continued to work with the Nelson Mandela
        Children’s Fund he set up in 1995 and established the Nelson Mandela
        Foundation and The Mandela Rhodes Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In April 2007 his grandson, Mandla Mandela, was installed as head of the
        Mvezo Traditional Council at a ceremony at the Mvezo Great Place. Nelson
        Mandela never wavered in his devotion to democracy, equality and
        learning. Despite terrible provocation, he never answered racism with
        racism. His life is an inspiration to all who are oppressed and
        deprived; and to all who are opposed to oppression and deprivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        He died at his home in Johannesburg on 5 December 2013.
